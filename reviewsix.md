### Rating
I give this game a 5 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
Guacamelee is an action platformer game where the player takes control of a luchador who has to find the strength to become a hero that he always wanted to be and save El Presidentes daughter form an evil spirit named Carlos Calaca. In the game, player will be able to use a variety of moves that will help them defeat enemies and get pass obstacles.
There are a total 10 stages all with there own unique visuals, enemies and bosses. The enemies the player will have to fight will be different based on what stage the player is on such as fighting skeletons and dark spirits in the world of the dead and monstrous plants and tribal hunters in the dark forest. The enemies will become more difficult based on how far you are in the stage till the point where you have to fight the boss of the stage.
In every stage there are hidden statues that will give the player special abilities. Each new ability will give new combat moves and power ups such as double upper cut and movement upgrades. These abilities will helpful as defeating a boss will require a certain move to dodge or get to its weak point and also getting pass obstacles to get to the next stage such as using wall jump to reach the end of the stage.


## Final Thoughts
Guacamelee is a unique game in its own way as it combines Metroid style stages with action platform and brawler combat. It is great every stage is different with their own challenges as this would make the player want to continue playing to see what will come next. I like that the games characters and environments are based off of traditional Mexican culture and folklore. I recommend this game for those that like action platformers or beat em up games.
