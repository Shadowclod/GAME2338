## Summary
Papers, Please is a simulator indie game where you play as a border checkpoint officer in a fictional Eastern Europe country called Arstotzka. In the game, your job is to review each immigrant and returning citizens passports and paperwork to make sure they have everything needed to go pass the border. After each day, you will be payed a certain amount based on your performance and you can use the money to buy food, heat or other thing for your family as you have to take care of them.
	
The game will mostly take place at your checkpoint as your objective is to make sure each arrival has the right paperwork or information to let them through. It is important that you check everything from expiration dates to picture ids as if you let a person in with incorrect information, you will have a pay deduction as punishment. Each day will be different as rules and required paperwork will change due to political events which can make the game difficult.
	
When you are inspecting the arrivals information, you will have a variety of tools to help you such as a handbook, figure printing and body scans. These tools are important as they will help you determine if the person has everything in order or not. Inspecting all the information is very important as some of the passports or paperwork can sometimes be stolen or forged and some of the arrivals can be smugglers, wanted criminals or even terrorists. There will be special events that will happen on some of the days that will alter the ending of the game such as failing to stop a terroristâ€™s attack or helping an underground resistance.


## Final Thoughts
The reason I like Papers, Please is because it is something that has not been done which is a game about border patrol. It is unique that you have to check every small detail to make sure the person is good to pass or not. I especially like that you are required to check even more stuff based on what is happening on the political side which makes the game more challenging. Papers, Please is a unique game and I recommend it if you like simulators or what to test your judgment.
