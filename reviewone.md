## Summary
Darkest Dungeon is a side scrolling RPG game about a group of heroes exploring different dungeons around the town of Hamlet to earn rewards and to also show how stressful dungeon exploring can be. In the game, the player controls and manages a roster of heroes with different abilities and quirks. The hero’s abilities will show the player what type of class they are such as a hero being an attacker, defender or a supporter. Base on the abilities the hero has, it will also show players what position in the group they will be must useful in such being in the front, middle or back of the group. When the player recruits a new hero, they will start off with random quirks that will be either positive or negative and this will affect the explorations and battles which can make situations better or worst.
	
  There are five different dungeons to explore in the game, all with their own unique events, enemies and bosses. Each dungeon will have different missions the player can accept to do and will receive special rewards for completing them such earning money and items. Some of these missions can go from just exploring to fighting every enemy in the dungeon. When the player has done enough missions, they will unlock a boss mission which they can fight the boss of that dungeon for bigger rewards but will have to plan carefully as the boss fights in the game can be difficult.
	
  Before the player can start a mission, they will have to buy supplies such as food, touches and other items. Once the player made its group and preparations, the exploration of the dungeon begins as the player will have to go through different rooms and hallways till the mission is complete. While the group is exploring, there can be random events such as finding interesting objects or enemy encounters. When the player does have to fight, the combat will be done in a turn-based style where each hero and enemy will take turns to attack or use an ability. If the battle or the dungeon becomes difficult to the player, they will have the option to retreat but will lose all the items they found in the dungeon.
	
  One of the unique things Darkest Dungeon has is the affection system. This is where players have to make sure that their heroes do not become too stressed out as it can affect the other heroes in the group and make them have major debuffs. Stress can happen overtime while exploring the dungeon, failing to disarm a trap or an enemy making a stress related attack during a battle. The only way the hero can remove stress is by successfully disarming a trap, resting at a campsite, or taking a break in Hamlet once the mission is over.

## Final Thoughts
Darkest Dungeon is a very unique RPG game and that’s why I like it. Not only you have to worry about the hero’s health but mainly their stress as while exploring a dungeon there can be events that can have negative results such as adding more stress or debuffs. This will make players think and make difficult decisions based on what the event is such as reading this mysterious book or activating this statue. Every hero has their own unique abilities and forming the right group can make the difference in both exploring and in combat. I recommend Darkest Dungeon for those that like RPG games or games that have a special challenge to them.
