I give this game a 5 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
Broforce is a side scrolling action game about a team of heroes that have to stop terrorists’ forces, aliens and other evil thing from taking over the world and destroying Americas freedom. In the game, players will take the role of different heroes or “Bros” with different abilities and weapons. 

There is a total of 17 levels with multiple stages to them all with unique enemies and environments. The enemies the player will face can go from easy to difficult depending on which level you are on such fighting gunners and bombers to aliens and terrorbots. The environments in each level are all destructible as you can easily destroy buildings, bridges and even the ground itself. This can be a challenge as destroying everything can kill you such as having a piece of environment falling on you or falling to the bottom of the stage. 

The most important part of the game are the heroes or “Bros” as each one is based off of character from different action movies and tv shows all their own unique abilities and weapons. Some of weapons can go from guns and explosives to swords and flamethrowers. The abilities depending on which hero the player is playing as can be luring in enemies to a trap or automatically target enemies in range. 


## Final Thoughts
Broforce is a great side scrolling action because it is a homage to the over the top action movies and tv show from the 80s, 90s and 2000s. I think it is great that everything can be destroyed and it bring a challenge to the player as you might get carried away and destroy the ground you are standing on and die. Each of the heroes are great and I like that their ability and weapons are connected with the character from the movie or show they are from such as Bro Hard (John McClane) from Die Hard with his dual machine guns and Ash Brolliams from Evil Dead with his shotgun and chainsaw. I recommend this game to those that like side scrolling action games or fans of action movies.
