### Rating
I give this game 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
Mercenary Kings is a run â€˜n gun platformer game where player can take the role of a mercenary king or empress and have to stop a fearsome force known as CLAW and save the world. In the game, player will be able to do traditional movements like jump, crouch, roll and also shoot in multiple directions and can use a melee weapons for short range attacks. The game will have some RPG elements such as weapon stats and a level up system.

There are over 100 missions in the game that will contain a variety of enemies, bosses and locations. The objectives of each mission are different as they can be hostage rescues, target eliminations or boss battles. After each mission, the player will be able to earn points to level up their rank which can unlock more challenging mission, weapons and increase their health.

The game also features a customization system which player can make their own weapons with a variety of gun parts that will change the stats of the gun and what type of bullets it fires. To be able to get gun parts, the player will have to complete certain missions, level up to a certain rank or even craft them with materials you find on the field. Depending on what part the player picks, it will change the guns magazine size, firepower and firing rate. Making the right combination will make a difference in difficult situations.


## Final Thoughts
Mercenary kings is a good game but has some flaws to it. What makes this game good is that it is a platformer mixed with a little bit of RPG elements as the gun you make will have different stats to it and you will be able to craft your own parts. The gameplay is enjoyable as it plays similar like metal slug and it has great character designs and animations. Some of the flaws the game has is that it becomes a little bit boring as some of the missions are repeats and there are barely any changes to them such as different enemies and locations. Overall, it is a good platformer game with different elements to it and I recommend it to those that like to try something a little bit different or fans of arcade style games.
