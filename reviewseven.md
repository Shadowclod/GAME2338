I give this game 4 out of 5 Stars.

## Summary
Audiosurf is a rhythm puzzle racer where players take the role of a racer and race through any type of music. In the game, players will have to maneuver down a colorful mult lane highway collecting blocks. The controls are simple as you can move around using the mouse or arrow keys and you can even use game controllers such as an Xbox 360 controller which will give you the rumble feature.

In the game, the main goal is to score points by collecting the different color blocks and forming a cluster of three. The more blocks the player gets in the cluster, the more points the player will score. There are special awards in each track such as finishing the song with all of the blocks collected or collecting blocks with a certain color. The one block the player must avoid are the gray blocks as if the player hits to many of them, the track will end.

One of the important features of the game is that the player can used their own music. If a player uses a custom music file such as a MP3 or a WMAs, the game will generate a special track for that song. Depending on the song the player uses, the track will become difficult but it will mostly be based on how fast the song is or how many beats it has.


## Final Thoughts
I like this about the game but didn't like this particular feature. This should be at a minimum of one paragraph.
