### Rating
I give this game a 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary
 Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a side scrolling platform puzzle game where players take the role of Abe, a worker at a meat factory that have to escape and discover his destiny. In the game, the player has to go through different areas of the factory and different areas of the world outside the factory as well. Each area will have different challenges to them such as special platforms, guards and even traps and it is up to the player how to get pass them.
The player will have different powers to use to help solve some the challenges in the game.  The powers are telepathy based powers which the player can use to read hidden messages and possessing enemies. The messages will sometimes give you hits on the upcoming area or even give you a heads up on what enemies or traps will come up in a future area as well. Possessing an enemy will allow the player to use and control their abilities such as using their weapons against other threats or simply disable traps or obstacles.
During each area, the player will come across other workers in the factory and will have the option to rescues them. If the player decides to rescue the workers, they will have special commands the player can use on them such as follow me, stay put or activate mechanism. To be able to rescue them, you will have to lead them to safety and active a portal by using your powers. If the player ignores the workers, it will make solving the area a lot easier but you will get a different ending based on how many workers you save.


## Final Thoughts
Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty is a good game and I like it because it is a very challenging puzzle platforming game. Mainly because the game sometimes makes you think and wants you to try different actions based on what the area contains. It is also unique that you can get one of the two endings based on how many workers you save which brings an extra challenge to the game and makes you take the time to save them as you want to see what the true ending is. I recommend Oddworld: New ‘n’ Tasty to anyone that like puzzle games or games that give them a challenge.
